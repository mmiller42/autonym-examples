# Basic Example

This is the simplest working example of Autonym using Babel.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your machine and install the dependencies for this example.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmiller42/autonym-examples.git
cd autonym-examples/basic
npm install
```

## Running

The API runs on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable, or defaults to `3000`.

Run the app in development mode. This will watch for changes and recompile.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, you can build from the source and then start the app.

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
